Compatibility

This project aims to work with a handful of "base" Friday Night Funkin' Engines in such a way no patches conflict with eachother

- [the Base Game](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin)
- [Forever Engine](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Forever-Engine-Archive)
- [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)

What is a patch?
</h1>

What exactly is a **patch**? well, GitHub has a feature that allows for users to inject code with files, when patches are applied to a repository, every file that is specified on the patch is modified, it's kinda like making a GitHub commit but containing it on a single file
