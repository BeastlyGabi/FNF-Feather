Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, to make your work easier you can also go ahead and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

Make a fork of **any** of the listed repositories from the [Compatiblity](/README.md#compatibility) section on our README file

now, clone your repository from your fork by clicking on the "Code" button, and then on the Paper Button after the link
